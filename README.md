1. Token (consist of two alphanumeric character each, A9 F5 FF)
2. Matrix (consist of tokens choosed to arrange code sequence)
3. Sequence (series of token (two or more) that has to be matched)

## Program requirement
This program require GNU g++ to be installed beforehand

## How to run the program
```
cd bin
./main
```
## How to use

1. By using .txt file, place the .txt file inside test/input folder
the structure of the .txt file is
```
buffer_size
matrix_width matrix_height
matrix
number_of_sequences
sequences_1
sequences_1_reward
sequences_2
sequences_2_reward
â€¦
sequences_n
sequences_n_reward
```

2. By using a random generator
